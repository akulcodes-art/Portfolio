CrickInformer Backend Overview CrickInformer is a robust backend service built with Spring Boot that provides real-time and comprehensive cricket match information. The application fetches live match data, scores, and tournament point tables by scraping the web, processes the information, and exposes it through a clean RESTful API. This service can be used as the backbone for any frontend application (web or mobile) that needs up-to-date cricket data.

The project demonstrates a strong understanding of backend development principles, including API design, web scraping, data persistence with a relational database, and Spring Boot architecture.

Features Get Live Matches: Provides a list of all currently live cricket matches with detailed information like scores, venue, and live status text.

Get All Matches: Fetches a complete list of matches stored in the database.

Get World Cup Point Table: Scrapes and returns the latest points table for major tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup.

Data Persistence: Automatically saves and updates match data into a MySQL database to maintain a history and reduce redundant scraping.

Tech Stack Framework: Spring Boot 3
